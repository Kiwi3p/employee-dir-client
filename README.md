# Postlight Employee directory challenge
# Front End portion

This is my react based front end for the employee directory. 
I used tailwind CSS for most of the components, tying together some nice styling at the end with plain CSS.

AOS Animations exist on scroll up, and there are page transitions as well.

# The biggest challenge

For some reason, the edit function, as straight forward as it is, is a bit buggy.
Other challenges involved the AUTOCOMPLETE searchbar
This one has HORRIBLE CSS and I apologize. If given more time I'd correct that as well.

# What I'd like to add

More animations! I love this Library Lottie that lets you add After Effects animations in. I just didn't have time to make something in AE!
